Tube Tech produces smooth bore 70/30 cupro nickel tubes of the highest standard, rigorously tested to make sure they are suitable for the exacting requirement of condensers and heat exchangers. These cupro nickel tubes have the highest resistance to stress-corrosion cracking. These tubes are available in a variety of outside diameter, wall thickness and tempers to meet the requirement. Superior dimensional control with specified mechanical properties offers trouble free performance and cost saving.

<p class="text-justify">
This form of cupro nickel tube gives the best service life under the most adverse conditions because of improved corrosion resistance and almost insensitive to stress corrosion. These cupro nickel tubes are used in heat exchangers where severe erosion and corrosion have been experienced, especially at elevated temperatures, high velocities and extreme turbulence of the circulating media. These cupro nickel tubes have an important bearing not only on the performance of heat exchangers but also on the cost and delivery cycle time of the condenser and heat exchangers where they are used.
