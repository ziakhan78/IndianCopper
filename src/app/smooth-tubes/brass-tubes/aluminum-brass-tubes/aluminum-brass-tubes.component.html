Aluminum brass tubes are highly accepted and one of the extensively used material for various industrial applications. This alloy develops a protective film that has self-healing properties. This film is dependent on oxygen, which is dissolved in the water and does not renew itself in polluted or stagnant water. High resistance to corrosion in clean seawater or in land conditions is difficult.
