All holes on the manifold are punched with collars to provide the highest brazing strength. All brazing is done with purged nitrogen and thoroughly cleaned to eliminate any contamination. All finished copper sub-assemblies are thoroughly inspected throughout the fabrication process to ensure the highest dimensional accuracy. Each sub-assembly is pressurized to ensure that all brazed joints are leak proof.
