Tube beading is a versatile form of end forming, used in a variety of industrial applications. A beaded end is used to interconnect exhaust tubes or low pressure fuel lines, used for O-rings, used to connect hoses to a tube end, used to dampen vibration in solid lines or to increase the effectiveness of the seal when a rubber or fabric sleeve is clamped to a metal duct. We are capable of producing beads on tube diameters 4 mm to 75 mm with a variety of thickness combinations. Width and height of the bead can be formed as per the requirement of the Customer. Depending upon the requirement of the Customer single, double Or multiple beading can be formed on the tube.

Tube Tech produces good quality, smooth and wrinkle free tubes with expanded ends. Tubes are expanded at ends to accommodate the adjoining tube of the same diameter to ensure proper sealed, leak proof joints. Our facilities allow us to form tube end expansion on tube diameters 4 mm to 55 mm and tubes can be expanded up to a diameter 30% Or even more of the original tube diameter, as per the Customer’s specific requirements. The percentage of expansion varies with tube material and depends on the elasticity & strength of the subjected tube material.

Our facilities allow us to form tube end reduction on tube diameters 6 mm to 55 mm and tubes can be reduced to a diameter 25% Or even less of the original tube diameter, as per the Customer’s specific requirements. The percentage of reduction varies with tube material and depends on the elasticity & strength of the subjected tube material. The length of reduced diameter can be achieved as per the requirement.

Tube Tech manufactures high quality, perfect finish end formed tubes with flared ends to form a liquid tight, airtight connection at the end of a tube. When creating flaring between 10° and 90°, with clamping lengths of about 1 x D, our products make a perfect sealing surface. Tubes with flared end can be produced with tube diameters 5 mm to 75 mm and wall thickness of 0.4 mm and above and in lengths as required by the Customer. We offer Tubes with Flared End with an accuracy that matches the exact shape of matching fittings Or connection.

Tube Tech offers a full range of tube threading capabilities, not just standard “pre-bend” threading. We can apply threading to the entire tube, to select sections along its length, at one or both ends - as required by the Customer Or drawing. We can even form threading after tube bending for better, cleaner threads and a lower cost end product. Tube with Threaded Ends are available in outer diameters 6 mm and above with wall thickness 0.9 mm and above and in lengths as required by the Customer. We can produce female threads on tube inner diameter on specific requirement of our Customers.

Though it is most common at the ends, flattening can be applied anywhere along the length of your tube product. Flattening is also necessary prior to adding certain other tube end treatments. Depending on the wall thickness and diameter of the tube, flattening can require incredibly high amounts of pressure and Tube Tech has the high capacity presses needed to flatten the tubes to any level our Customers specify.

Tube Tech specializes in forming all types of Punching and piercing on a variety of tube materials, be it Copper, Brass, Cupro Nickel, Stainless Steel Or Aluminum. We form both dimple hole punching and piercing as well as Mandrel hole punching and piercing with same accuracy. Tube punching is the process of making a uniform hole with minimal distortion in a tube with a die 
supported by a mandrel. Tube “piercing” is the process of making a  hole with a punch but without a die or die support. The resulting hole  is dimpled We can form round or shaped holes in single or multiple hole configurations in round, square or rectangle tubing or pipe, depending upon requirement of the Customer Or drawing. We can also offer multiple holes in a row or multiple holes on different planes to be punched simultaneously.

We can also form these range of tubes with stainless steel, aluminum and carbon steel tube materials. Different forms and shapes of notch and slots can be achieved using our set of machines, tooling and technical expertise. We are capable of producing tubular designs that are more intricate in shape, have a unique shape, or have multiple slots that are close in proximity to one another, cutting a V – shape out of a square tube so that the two tube sections can fold up to a 45 degree or 90 degree angle, or special notch and slot combinations on requirement from our Customers.
