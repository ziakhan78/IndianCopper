<p class="text-justify">	
 Tube Tech produces Corrugated Fin Tubes with Internal and external spiral corrugated copper fins of 0.5 mm to 1.2 mm height which creates progressive turbulence giving a high degree of thermal conductivity. These fin tubes are made from thin walled smooth tubes of wall thickness as low as 0.5 mm. These fin tubes are fabricated by using a special process where the outer and the inner surfaces are given spiral-shaped rotating impressions which equips corrugated tube with excellent thermal properties. These corrugated tubes have greater heat transfer to the inner side of the tube and allow for better condensation run-off. </p>	
<p class="text-justify">
The Tube diameter can range from 12.7 to 25.4 mm and wall thickness from 0.50 to 2.11 mm with corrugation pitch 3 mm to 12 mm. These fin tubes can be produced in Copper, Brass & Cupro Nickel Tube Material as per the requirement. These fin tubes are available in lengths up to 8 meters. Bigger lengths can be accommodated on request.
